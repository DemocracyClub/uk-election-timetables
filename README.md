This library encapsulates timetable legislation for elections run in the United Kingdom and its devolved administrations.

The election timetable varies based on:

 * *Type of Post* - Parliamentary, Local, devolved Government, etc.
 * *Country* - The United Kingdom has up to four different rules for the same type of election, one for each country.
 * *Calendar* - each country has their own unique set of Bank Holidays.

## Usage (publishing of candidate lists)

```python
from datetime import date
from uk_election_timetables.elections.uk_parliament import UKParliamentElection

election = UKParliamentElection(date(2019, 2, 21))

print(election.sopn_publish_date) # date(2019, 1, 25)
```

## Updating Bank Holiday Dates
This project checks daily for additions to the government bank holiday dataset at https://www.gov.uk/bank-holidays.json. When an addition is identified in the .gov file, this project will automatically create a GitHub issue to update our local bank holiday dataset.

To update `bank-holidays.json` with additions from the government supplied file, run the following within your venv:
```commandline
python manage_bank_holidays.py --update
```
